<p>While this demo has been tested in IOS and works, it is still work in progress.</p>

<p>During my first React Native prototype project I couldn't find a good example of Firebase working with React Native. Instructions described here: <a href="https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-05-29-react-native.html">https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-05-29-react-native.html</a> didn't work as I expected. </p>

<p>I wrote this example based on Firebase official docs and demo: </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/firebase/login-demo-ios">https://github.com/firebase/login-demo-ios</a> 
<a href="https://github.com/firebase/firebase-simple-login-objc/blob/master/docs/v1/providers/twitter.md">https://github.com/firebase/firebase-simple-login-objc/blob/master/docs/v1/providers/twitter.md</a></p>

<p>Objective-C is far from being my main expersite (please, don't take this doc as reference for good practices) With a little bit of work, I managed to expose a React Bridge containing a few methods that allowed me to authenticate with Twitter and persist the user in my Firebase database. It also contains an example on how to fetch data from a react native component using Firebase REST API.</p>

<p>This demo implements Firebase's authentication features and it focuses on Twitter Oauth methods.
Note that Firebase also supports authentication with email &amp; password and custom auth tokens as well as other providers (Facebook, Linkedin, Google, etc.)
You can read the full <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/user-auth.html">iOS authentication guide here</a>.</p>

<p>This demo requires that <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a> is installed.</p>

<h2>
<a id="running-the-demo" class="anchor" href="#running-the-demo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running the Demo</h2>

<p>Donwload the repository and run the following command in the root folder:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install
</code></pre>

<p>To download and setup all necessary SDKs, run the following command within ./ios/:</p>

<pre><code>$ pod install
</code></pre>

<p>Next, open <code>reactAndFireBase.xcworkspace</code> in XCode (not <code>reactAndFireBase.xcodeproj</code>,
since you need to include the Cocoapod dependencies).</p>

<p>You'll then need to edit the files <code>reactAndFirebase/ViewController.m</code> and specify the
Firebase app you're using as well as your Twitter API key. </p>

<p>Don't forget to <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/user-auth.html#section-enable-providers">enable the relevant OAuth providers</a>
in your Firebase app.</p>

<p>Finally, run the demo app in XCode.</p>

<p>React Version: ^0.11.4</p>

<h2>
<a id="troubleshooting" class="anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If your build fails, check that pod install had run successfuly. If the console throws this warning, most likely you will have to follow the instructions and then re-run the command. </p>

<p>[!] The <code>reactAndFirebase [Debug]</code> target overrides the <code>OTHER_LDFLAGS</code> build setting defined in <code>Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the</code>$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.</p>

<p>[!] The <code>reactAndFirebase [Release]</code> target overrides the <code>OTHER_LDFLAGS</code> build setting defined in <code>Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the</code>$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.</p>

<p>I had to remove the Tests from the project as well to get it working.</p>
