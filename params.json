Instructions described here: https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-05-29-react-native.html didn't work as I expected. \r\n\r\nI wrote this example based on Firebase official docs and demo: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/firebase/login-demo-ios \r\nhttps://github.com/firebase/firebase-simple-login-objc/blob/master/docs/v1/providers/twitter.md\r\n\r\nObjective-C is far from being my main expersite (please, don't take this doc as reference for good practices) With a little bit of work, I managed to expose a React Bridge containing a few methods that allowed me to authenticate with Twitter and persist the user in my Firebase database. It also contains an example on how to fetch data from a react native component using Firebase REST API.\r\n\r\nThis demo implements Firebase's authentication features and it focuses on Twitter Oauth methods.\r\nNote that Firebase also supports authentication with email & password and custom auth tokens as well as other providers (Facebook, Linkedin, Google, etc.)\r\nYou can read the full [iOS authentication guide here](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/user-auth.html).\r\n\r\nThis demo requires that [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed.\r\n\r\nRunning the Demo\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nDonwload the repository and run the following command in the root folder:\r\n\r\n\t$ npm install\r\n\r\nTo download and setup all necessary SDKs, run the following command within ./ios/:\r\n\r\n    $ pod install\r\n\r\nNext, open `reactAndFireBase.xcworkspace` in XCode (not `reactAndFireBase.xcodeproj`,\r\nsince you need to include the Cocoapod dependencies).\r\n\r\nYou'll then need to edit the files `reactAndFirebase/ViewController.m` and specify the\r\nFirebase app you're using as well as your Twitter API key. \r\n\r\nDon't forget to [enable the relevant OAuth providers](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/guide/user-auth.html#section-enable-providers)\r\nin your Firebase app.\r\n\r\nFinally, run the demo app in XCode.\r\n\r\nReact Version: ^0.11.4\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n----------------\r\nIf your build fails, check that pod install had run successfuly. If the console throws this warning, most likely you will have to follow the instructions and then re-run the command. \r\n\r\n[!] The `reactAndFirebase [Debug]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation\r\n    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or\r\n    - Remove the build settings from the target.\r\n\r\n[!] The `reactAndFirebase [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation\r\n    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or\r\n    - Remove the build settings from the target.\r\n\r\nI had to remove the Tests from the project as well to get it working.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
